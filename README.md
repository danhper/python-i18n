# python-i18n

This library provides i18n functionality for Python 3 out of the box. The usage is mostly based on Rails i18n library.

## Installation

Simply download the package and run

    python setup.py install

Make sure you are using Python 3. If you want to use YAML translation files, you will need PyYAML installed as well. If you are using `easy_install`, you can use

    easy_install python-i18n[yaml]

to install both.

## Usage
### Basic usage

The simplest, though not very useful usage would be

    import i18n
    i18n.add_translation('foo', 'bar')
    i18n.t('foo') # bar

### Using translation files

YAML and JSON formats are supported to store translations. With the default configuration, if you have the following `foo.en.yml` file

    en:
      hi: Hello world !

in `/path/to/translations` folder, you simply need to add the folder to the translations path.

    import i18n
    i18n.load_path.append('/path/to/translations')
    i18n.t('foo.hi') # Hello world !

### Namespaces

#### File namespaces
In the above example, the translation key is `foo.hi` and not just `hi`. This is because the translation filename format is by default `{namespace}.{locale}.{format}`, so the {namespace} part of the file is used as translation.

#### Directory namespaces
If your files are in subfolders, the foldernames are also used as namespaces, so for example if your translation root path is `/path/to/translations` and you have the file `/path/to/translations/my/app/name/foo.en.yml`, the translation namespace for the file will be `my.app.name` and the file keys will therefore be accessible from `my.app.name.foo.my_key`.

## Funcionalities
### Placeholder

You can of course use placeholders in your translations. With the default configuration, the placeholders are used by inserting `%{placeholder_name}` in the ntranslation string. Here is a sample usage.

    i18n.add_translation('hi', 'Hello %{name} !')
    i18n.t('hi', name='Bob') # Hello Bob !

### Pluralization

Pluralization is based on Rail i18n module. By passing a `count` variable to your translation, it will be pluralized. The translation value should be a dictionnary with at least the keys `one` and `many`. You can add a `zero` key when needed, if it is not present `many` will be used instead. Here is a sample usage.

    i18n.add_translation('mail_number', {
        'zero': 'You do not have any mail.',
        'one': 'You have a new mail.',
        'many': 'You have %{count} new mails.'
    })
    i18n.t('mail_number', count=0) # You do not have any mail.
    i18n.t('mail_number', count=1) # You have a new mail.
    i18n.t('mail_number', count=5) # 'You have 5 new mails.
